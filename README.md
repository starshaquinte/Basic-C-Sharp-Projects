# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

<h3>Projects:</h3>

- Car Insurance
  This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user input on
  policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that 
  allows staff to review all of the quotes that have been issued.
