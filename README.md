# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

<h3>Projects:</h3>

- **Car Insurance**
  This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user input on
  policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that 
  allows staff to review all of the quotes that have been issued.
  
- **BooleanLogic** 
    Created a basic approval program for car insurance.  The application asks the user questions 
    to determine if they are qualified. Uses examples of boolean logic.
    
- **Branching** 
    Create a console application for getting a shipping quote on a package. User enters the dimensions of the 	
    package to see if its too big. Application uses simple math and branching statements to determine a quote 
    for the package to be shipped. 
    
- **DailyReport** 
    Created a Daily Report for Tech Academy Students using user input to move to the next question.  
    Displays an example of using boolean logic 
    
- **MathAndComparisonOperators** 
    Created an anonymous income comparison program. Prints hourly rate and hours worked per week to 
    the console for user 1 and user 2.  Prints annual salary for both users and compares salary to 
    see who make the most.
