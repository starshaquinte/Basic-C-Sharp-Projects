# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

<h3>Projects:</h3>

- **Car Insurance**
  This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user input on
  policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that 
  allows staff to review all of the quotes that have been issued.
  
- **BooleanLogic** 
    Created a basic approval program for car insurance.  The application asks the user questions 
    to determine if they are qualified. Uses examples of boolean logic.
